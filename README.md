### App Idea
I’d like to build **“StudySync”**, a group study coordination app that helps students form, schedule, and manage study sessions. Key features would include:
- **Smart Matching**: Pair you with peers studying the same topics or courses.  
- **Integrated Pomodoro Timer**: Built-in focus timer with group progress tracking.  
- **Resource Hub**: Shared note boards, flashcards, and resource links for each session.  
- **Availability Polls**: Quick polls to find the best meeting time, synced with your calendar.  

This app would streamline the process of finding study partners, staying focused during sessions, and collaboratively building study materials. Feel free to suggest any other features!
